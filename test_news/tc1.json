    "body": "There was probably no way the first presidential debate could live up to the hype of nearly three­quarters of Americans saying they planned to watch it. No one lost the debate. No one won the election. There was no iconic moment that will replayed for decades. There small moments that will be remembered for weeks — but not months — such as Hillary Clinton’s shoulder wiggle or Donald Trump’s sniffling. Further, neither candidate did what they had to do from the broader perspective of sealing the race. Clinton didn’t use the opportunity in front of the largest audience she will ever have to make herself more likable and trustworthy. Trump didn’t use any of the questions to talk in a substantial way about policy. But in the end, who won? It wasn’t even close: Clinton landed more punches and won more rounds. Here’s how: Clinton played offense, even if Trump had the ball more often Subscribe Starting at 99 cents Members Sign In Tweet Share 55 Comments Clinton played offense, even if Trump had the ball more often Use whatever sports analogy suits you, but I prefer a soccer game to describe this debate. Clinton was the team that dominated possession, seeing holes open up and exploiting them one after another. She kept Trump in a position of continuously reacting to her comments instead of the other way around. Memorable momentsfrom the presidential debate There were a number of well­turned phrases — even a few that stood up to Lloyd Bentsen’s “You’re no Jack Kennedy.” Fact checking the presidential debate Clinton, Trump clash in first presidential debate Dan Wasserman: An illustrative look at the first presidential debate Trump may have actually spent more time speaking in the debate, but much of it was on defense. Clinton began in the first few minutes by saying Trump’s father gave him $14 million in loans. He immediately dove into trying to explain himself — instead of talking about, for example, creating jobs. She continued this pattern until she eventually scored. He talked in detail about not releasing tax returns. He explained his previous defense of birtherism. He finished by defending his disparaging comments about women. Clinton pivoted away from her weaknesses View Story Tweet Share 55 Comments 1 of 5 free articles. Subscribe now Clinton didn’t leave the debate totally unscathed. But even when the discussion quickly went to her most dangerous ground — the e­mails — she was able to admit her mistake and move away from the topic within 20 seconds. She pivoted to attack Trump, and the issue never returned in a substantial way. Similarly, when Trump criticized President Obama and President Bill Clinton on trade, the GOP nominee accused her of having no plan to create jobs. Clinton responded that she did have a plan. It was in a book. Finally, when Trump attacked Clinton for taking some time off to prepare for the debate, she turned it into a positive by saying she also is prepared to be president. Clinton made the debate about Trump Clinton managed to make a question on a recent cyberattack about Trump’s relationship with the Vladimir Putin. Trump’s responded “no one knows” who hacked into the Democratic National Committee’s e­mails, and it could have been done by “someone ho weighs 400 pounds who is sitting on a bed. OK. Clinton also leveled a line about Trump believing that climate change is a hoax made up by the Chinese to hurt the US economy. Trump denied he said that, but he tweeted it in 2012. It became the most retweeted tweet of the entire debate. As a result, Trump missed his best opportunities to land a punch Trump missed so many opportunities to help himself. He continued to play to his base and not even attempt to appeal to hesitant Republicans. He did not admit any regrets on birtherism or past disparaging statements about women. In fact, he doubled down on them. He could have made news by releasing his tax returns on his website during the debate. He could have had a rhetorical theme to underscore Clinton as the status quo. He could have delivered some heartfelt thoughts about race in America. Instead he gave the same lines he gave to his partisan audiences at rallies."

    "body": "The big question going into the the first US presidential debate - an 90-minute encounter that had the power to decide the future of the world - was which Donald Trump would show up. Would it be the subdued, disciplined candidate, seeking to prove his credentials for the highest office in the land, or would it be street fighter who brawled and bullied his way to victory in the Republican primaries? Within moments of the debate getting underway, it was clear it was the latter. But if the testy Republican candidate thought he was going to have things all his own way, he was wrong. Hillary Clinton, well prepared and on-message, on Monday night threw as many punches as Mr Trump, dodged some of his swings at her, and landed some solid blows of her own. She may even have come out ahead, based on expectations going in. READ MORE Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a ‘dead heat’, says new poll By the end of the evening, the pair had probably each punched enough to please their own supporters. But it will be some days before the public learns if either of them won over any undecideds. It maybe that this hugely-hyped television event - one that an estimated 100m people were expected to watch - changed very little on the ground. A CNN/ORC snap poll said 62 per cent of respondents felt Ms Clinton won, and 27 per cent believed Mr Trump was the winner. “Donald, it’s good to be with you,” Ms Clinton said, as the pair shook hands as they arrived on the stage.

Over the next 90 minutes, he accused of her being an establishment politician who had achieved nothing during her lengthy career. He said contrary to what people may have learned in the mainstream media, he had “a better temperament” than his rival. “I have a winning temperament,” he said. trump-clinton-3.jpg Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks as Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton listens during their first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, U.S., September 26, 2016 (Rick Wilking/Reuters) She, in turn, sought to highlight him as a failed businessman who would do nothing to help America progress. He was not interested in science and ignored facts that did not suit his case. \"Donald, I know you live in your own reality.\" she said. Ms Clinton said that Mr Trump was a man with a “cavalier attitude” who could not be trusted to remain calm when dealing with difficult diplomatic situations. “A man who can  be provoked by a Tweet she not have his finger near the nuclear code,” she said. Ms Clinton demanded to know why Mr Trump would not release his tax returns, something every president has done in modern history. Mr Trump said he was unable to because he was being audited by the tax authorities. “This is something the American people have a right to see. I don’t think he will because he he trying to hide something,” she said, in one of her clearly rehearsed lines that landed with a genuine zing. “He is either not as rich as he says, he is not as charitable, he maybe doesn’t want the American people that he has paid nothing in federal income taxes.”Mr Trump responded by saying: “[That] makes me smart.”"

    "body": "For six days beginning on Oct. 21, visitors to the crenelated, fortresslike Park Avenue Armory will find its 19th-century interior transformed into a light, modern setting. Translucent scrims will obscure the dark-wood lobby and second-floor period rooms, which will open to the public for the first time since their recent restoration. Muted colors will turn the Drill Room into airy galleries. There’s a message in this metamorphosis, which was commissioned for the American debut of the European Fine Art Fair, known as Tefaf. With its careful vetting of objects on display, dating from antiquity to the present, the fair is considered the most prestigious art bazaar in the world. Tefaf’s arrival in Manhattan from its home in Maastricht, the Netherlands, is more than just another event on the cultural calendar. It’s an attempt by the fair, whose 270 exhibitors face a shrinking audience in Europe, to secure and revitalize its future. It’s a chance for dealers in historical art — Tefaf’s forte — to staunch the stampede of collectors into contemporary art and show that works of older art can look just as good in a modern setting as in a grand, classical home. And it’s a test of the global art market, which shrank to $63.8 billion in 2015, a 7 percent drop from 2014, and continues to wobble, judging by auction results, this year. “Many more people need to know what we are doing,” said Patrick van Maris, the fair’s chief executive. But can Maastricht convert Manhattan? The people Mr. van Maris refers to are, mostly, Americans, who buy more art than any other nationality but constitute only 2,000 to 2,500 of the 75,000 people who visit Tefaf Maastricht, a number that may dwindle further in an age of terrorism fears. Some longstanding exhibitors, like Otto Naumann, a New York dealer in old masters, are debating whether to continue showing at Maastricht at all. After years of pressure from exhibitors, Tefaf last winter agreed to collaborate with Artvest Partners, a New York advisory firm, on a split spectacle: a fall event for art through the 1920s and a second fair, in May, for modern and contemporary art and design. Mr. van Maris dismissed the idea that a soft market is not the time to establish a new outpost. Marc Porter, the former chairman of Christie’s Americas who is soon to take a high post at Sotheby’s, also played down the market gamble. “You can’t time the market,” he said. “You enter when the space and calendar become available and you have a critical mass of dealers.” But Tefaf New York Fall, which hopes to attract 22,000 visitors, is still a “risky bet,” according to Jonathan T. D. Neil, director of Sotheby’s Institute of Art-Los Angeles. “There’s so much that happens in New York already,” he said. “People have access to a lot of this material on a nonstop basis.” New York, in other words, is the opposite of Maastricht, and that may not be good. “Maastricht is a great fair because people go for a few days and there is nothing else to do, except restaurants,” said George Wachter, chairman of Sotheby’s North America and South America. “They go with buying in mind.” Photo Claude de France’s illuminated Book of Hours, which includes 39 miniatures, will be at the fair. Credit via Heribert Tenschert Antiquariat Bibermühle AG For the New York fair, from perhaps 300 applicants (Tefaf declined to provide the exact number), a committee selected 94 dealers, from 13 countries, with reputations for showing top-quality art that is fresh to the market. They will be offering not just old master paintings and sculpture, for which Maastricht is famed, but also jewelry, antiquities, books and manuscripts, American paintings and decorative arts, drawings, European furniture and African, Oceanic, Islamic and Asian art. About 20 dealers, from Buenos Aires to The Hague to Paris, have never exhibited in New York (or at least not in years). But Maastricht’s out-of-the-way location is only one of Tefaf’s challenges. There is also fair fatigue. In 2015 collectors could choose from 269 art fairs around the world, up from 105 in 2005, according to The Art Newspaper. The rotation of taste toward postwar and contemporary art has also hurt. Fairs like Art Basel in Switzerland, the premier contemporary fair, which regularly attracts 90,000 visitors, clearly helped enlarge the pool of collectors. Tefaf New York wants to show Americans that “a vast area of material, which they have really only seen in museums and a few galleries here,” can be theirs, said Frances Beatty, president of the New York dealer Richard L. Feigen & Company, who will be exhibiting in October. And visitors may find price points “that are not available in 20th-century art,” said Michael Plummer, a partner in Artvest. “You can get master works for less money.” Some buyers may come from an emerging group called cross-collectors, who buy in more than one category, starting, say, in contemporary and then adding traditional art. “I see more and more collectors going in both directions,” said Marc Spiegler, global director of Art Basel. The challenge is to enlarge that group. With Tefaf in New York, others are capitalizing on the moment. Christie’s, which has already created themed sale weeks and auctions that mix collecting categories, has moved up its sales of old masters and 19th-century art to Oct. 26. Fifteen Upper East Side dealers have organized October Art Week, beginning with evening receptions on Oct. 20. Many things could go wrong for Tefaf. For one, there is less than a week available to transform the Armory, then set up and vet the offerings. The fair may not attract attendees who buy enough to offset the higher costs in New York compared with Maastricht. The average cost of a Tefaf booth in New York is $38,500, more than twice that in Maastricht. Add to that “introduction” fees, setup and decorating costs (dealers do the interiors of their booths), shipping expenses, and money spent on staffing and travel. The total can run $100,000 to $250,000 per exhibitor, dealers say. Some dealers do not seem worried. “The business goes the whole year round,” said Jorge Coll, a partner at Colnaghi, a dealer with galleries in London and Madrid. “You may start things in Europe and finish them in the U.S. or vice versa.” Mr. van Maris, too, is taking a longer view. “Our audience said, ‘You have to be here.’ Let me tell you in a few years whether we’ve succeeded.”"
